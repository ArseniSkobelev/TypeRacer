## About:
My first real Python project from whom I learned to work with APIs and Tkinter GUI system.
This Python script GETs a random quote from https://api.quotable.io/random and then prompts you to enter the quote as fast as possible.  
It then decides whether you've entered the quote correctly and acts accordingly.

>   ## Further improvement ideas:
>   * Restart button  
>   * GUI design  
>   * Choice of quote length
